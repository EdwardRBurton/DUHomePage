    <h5>Project Title </h5>
      <p><strong>Pearce Jams</strong></p>
    <h5>Business Need</h5>
    <p>My wife is a high scholi teacher. She asked me to create a webpage that only plays music that she wants but it cannot be a website like Spotify, youtube, Pandora, etc. as those are blocked on the school wifi. I plan to create a clone of the popular music streaming site, Spotify, called Pearce Jams. This will be a fully functional web application that my wife can use in her classroom to play music. It will be hosted using Netlify that is supported on the district wifi.</p>

    <h5>Users</h5>
      <p> The main users of Pearce Jams is a small group of teachers that want to play music in their classrooms. Since all other platforms are blocked on the scholi wifi, they need a way to play music. One teacher asked: "Why not just use your cell phone?". Teachers using cellphones does not align with district plioicy on cellphones.</p>
    <h5>Goals</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Test the Prototype of Pearce Jams </li>
        <li>Collect teacher feedback </li>
        <li>Identify 2 or 3 items to improve the user expereince </li>
        <li>Devliver a better web app. </li>
      </ol>
    <h5>Tasks and Scenarios</h5>

        <strong>A new or veteran teacher</strong>
          <p>He/she is trying to create a welcoming atmophere in their classroom. Playing music will allow the teacher to introduce students to new forms of music that align with current curiculum. </p>
        <strong>A principle</strong>
          <p>Principles like to hightlight what they are doing to exchane the student expereince in their school. Having a named, and branded app like Pearce Jams would give them something to show parents and prospective students.</p>

    <h5>Success Measures</h5>
      <p>The main measurment of success for this app is use. If teachers use the app in their classroom, and show it off to students, it has the potential to gain more popularity. There is no cost to this app, but there will be a very limited playlist. </p>
    <h5>Competitors</h5>

      <strong>Teacher Smartphones</strong>
          <p>It would be easy for a teacher to just pull out their phone and start using it. It is, however, against district policy</p>
      <strong>Old School Boombox</strong>
          <p>This is a great option as it is within the district policy. Most teachers already have this in their classroom.</p>

    <h5>Risks</h5>
      <p>The main risk is the teachers/users will not wait on this new app and move to another platform/competitor. It would be easy for a teacher to just pull other there phone, play some classical music, and not use Pearce Jams. </p>
